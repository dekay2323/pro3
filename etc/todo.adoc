- [x] materialRequest.readOnlyRFQ()

- [ ] Tests

=== Main Points

- [ ] Validation is having problem on createRFQ (maybe use command object or errors)
- [ ] We should use command objects when the gsp is looking too far down the domains
- [ ] Get rid of i18n
- [ ] Better controller/service seperation
- [ ] Once RFQ issued cannot change rfq
- [ ] Tables all sorting
- [ ] RFQ status should be an enum
- [ ] vue.js inline editor
- [ ] TESTS
