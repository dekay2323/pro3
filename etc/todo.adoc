== Old
== Last Doing
- =[x] materialRequest.readOnlyRFQ()
- [ ] Make sure the auth is per user, not sure best approach to that.
- [ ] Url, user id and something else
- [ ] Tests

=== Main Points
- [ ] The URL should always take you to the page, REST
- [ ] Validation is having problem on createRFQ (maybe use command object or errors)
- [ ] We should use command objects when the gsp is looking too far down the domains
- [ ] Get rid of i18n
- [ ] Better controller/service seperation
- [ ] Once RFQ issued cannot change rfq
- [ ] Tables all sorting
- [ ] RFQ status should be an enum
- [ ] vue.js inline editor
- [ ] TESTS

=== Meeting Notes
==== Call with Nick
- [ ] Approvals
- [ ] Temp password
