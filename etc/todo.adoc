= Todo

== Sprint
* [x] Vendor 2 did not work, not authorized

* [x] RFQ, closing date

* Vendor Quote
** Bid number
** Contact name
** Contact phone number
** Date bid auto done

* Recommended Options
** First we have the quote on the line items in the RFQ
** A vendor can add optional items which should appear
** Options are for a specific vendor, each vendor has his own optional lines
** An option CAN be related to a line item

* Once Bid is sent, vendor needs a step to acknowledge (intention to bid or not)
** Not should have an explanation

* Vendor can change the bid until closing date
** There is no specific bid
** Notify how many days till bid finish

== Backlog
* Document adding
** AWS S3

* Quotes, should go read only after closing date

* Prebid clarification
** Vendor should be able to send questions to user
** User provides a response
** Response & Question have to go to ALL vendors
** The Question should be editable by the user (to get rid of vendor specific stuff)
** Prebid clarification list of questions and answers

* Clarification
** Once bids close, user does
*** Commercial Clarification
*** Technical Clarification


== Old
== Last Doing
- =[x] materialRequest.readOnlyRFQ()
- [ ] Make sure the auth is per user, not sure best approach to that.
- [ ] Url, user id and something else
- [ ] Tests

=== Main Points
- [ ] The URL should always take you to the page, REST
- [ ] Validation is having problem on createRFQ (maybe use command object or errors)
- [ ] We should use command objects when the gsp is looking too far down the domains
- [ ] Get rid of i18n
- [ ] Better controller/service seperation
- [ ] Once RFQ issued cannot change rfq
- [ ] Tables all sorting
- [ ] RFQ status should be an enum
- [ ] vue.js inline editor
- [ ] TESTS

=== Meeting Notes
